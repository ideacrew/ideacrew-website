  title: State Based Marketplace
  description: IdeaCrew pioneered the modular approach to developing Health
    Insurance Exchanges. At initial launch, states and the Federal Marketplace
    relied on big bang deployments. These deployments, which ran into the tens
    and even hundreds of millions of dollars, failed almost universally. Whether
    a state survived depended on how it reacted to these failures. The DC
    Exchange chose IdeaCrew to build a replacement Exchange over time,
    module-by-module. As a result, DC can lay claim to the first modular
    Exchange, and IdeaCrew is the vendor that built it.
